# SHARKEY.TS :shark: :sauropod:

***A Typescript library for Deno to interact with Sharkey, a Mastodon alternative. :shark: :sauropod:***

## ABOUT :books:

This library for Deno is there to interact with Sharkey from Typescript. I wrote this to prototype a library in another programming language and get a feel for Sharkey's API routes.

## TODO :gear:

- [ ] Write unit tests.
- [ ] Write documentation for all APIs.
- [ ] Upload to [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x).
- [ ] Add GitHub CI for unit tests.
- [ ] Add comments.
