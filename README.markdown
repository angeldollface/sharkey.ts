***A Typescript library for Deno to interact with Sharkey, a Mastodon alternative. :shark: :sauropod:***

## ABOUT :books:

This library for Deno is there to interact with Sharkey from Typescript. I wrote this to prototype a library in another programming language and get a feel for Sharkey's API routes.

## TODO :gear:

- [x] Write unit tests.
- [x] Upload to [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x).
- [x] Write documentation for all APIs.
- [x] Add GitHub CI for unit tests.
- [x] Add comments.

## USAGE :hammer:

### APIs

To get the documentation for this library, please visit this library's documentation pages s[here](https://angeldollface.boo/sharkey.ts). Please also take care to import ***Sharkey.ts*** via an HTTP import or by adding it to your Deno project. The documentation gives inaccurate information on imports (This is not down to me, this is a known issue with Deno.).

### EXAMPLE

To get a feel for how to use ***Sharkey.ts***, please read the unit tests located in [`mod_test.ts`](mod_test.ts).

## CHANGELOG :black_nib:

### Version 0.1.0

- Initial release.
- Upload to GitHub.
- Upload to [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x).
